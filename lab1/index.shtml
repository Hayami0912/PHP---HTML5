			<h3>Professional & Personal Details</h3>
			<p>
				Hi my name is Nhat Nguyen. 
				I am going by Nate with my friends to avoid being called gnat.
				I was born in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and moved to the States since 2007.
				I have lived in Virginia ever since. I am a transfer student from NVCC. 
				I often traveled throughout South East Asia countries when I was young; Singapore, Malaysia Thailand, Japan, China. 
				However, I have yet to get a chance to travel outside of the States ever since I moved; traveling might have to wait until school is over.
				I am currently majored in IT concentrated in DTP and working as a junior network engineer for a MSSP.
